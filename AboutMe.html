    <dt><b>Soccer</b></dt>
    <dd>I've been playing soccer ever since I was 9 years old and I've experienced some of the highest highs and the lowest lows.
    The hard work and commitment I have learned from the sport has translated to every aspect of my life.</dd>
    <dt><b>Piano</b></dt>
    <dd>I had taken piano lessons as a child and use the skills to
    play for my church back at home. It is a beautiful way to
destress after a long day and it feels pleasent to play for others. </dd>
<dt><b>Volleyball</b></dt>
<dd>My entire family plays volleyball so we use it as a way to come together during family gatherings. Volleyball has
all of their players in a small court which helps keep the whole family sociable.</dd></article>
